        <h2>Profile</h2>
        <h3>Likes, Dislikes, and Restrictions</h3>
        <p>These values are what make the FoodMob search sort the restaurant results so that you can find one that
        best matches your tastes.  To add to or remove from each of these values, simply navigate to your profile
        and select the appropriate category.  You will then be presented with a scrollable list of the available categories.
        You can add a non-selected category by clicking on its name and a check mark will appear next to it if you succeeded.
        You can deselect a selected category by clicking on it again and the check mark will disappear.  If you happen to 
        select a category that is part of your other criteria, it will be removed from that criteria and added to the one 
        where you selected it.</p>
        <h3>Account</h3>
        <p>The Password & Security button allows you to change your password.  The Legal and Help buttons show information 
        about FoodMob.  The Sign Out button can be used to log yourself out of the application.</p>
        <h2>Search</h2>
        <h3>Location</h3>
        <p>The location defaults to your current location if left blank and you allow FoodMob to use your location.  If this is disabled
        and you attempt to search on your current location a message will pop up to explain this.  To re-enable FoodMob's location 
        access, go to your settings and then to the FoodMob application.  Once there, select the Location button and choose "While Using 
        the App".</p>
        <h3>Additional Criteria</h3>

        <h3>Results</h3>
        After pressing the magnifying glass in the top right corner of the search page, if the search is successful it will take you 
        to a results page.  Here, the restaurants are listed in order with the ones found to be the best fit at the top.  You can 
        select each restaurant to view its rating, reviews, address, phone number, location on a map, and whether it is open or not.  
        You can also open the restaurant's Yelp page from here.
